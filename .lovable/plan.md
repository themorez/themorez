## Plan: Add introductory text to the About page hero section

### Change

**`src/pages/About.tsx`**
- Add a new `<p>` tag after the existing subtitle (line 17-18) inside the hero section with the provided text: *"I work at the intersection of literary studies, critical theory, and translation—supported by a strong background in academic research and English language teaching."*
- Style it similarly to the existing subtitle with `text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed` and a staggered animation.
